Why This Token Exists
QWBQ was created to provide a minimal and transparent BEP-20 reference contract deployed on BNB Smart Chain mainnet for real educational interaction.

The purpose of creating this token is to allow practical observation of how a fixed-supply BEP-20 contract behaves in a live blockchain environment.

It exists as a technical reference implementation — not as a financial or speculative product.

Who Benefits From It
QWBQ is intended for:

Students learning smart contract fundamentals
Developers studying BEP-20 token mechanics
Blockchain researchers analyzing on-chain behavior
Technical reviewers examining immutable contract design
It is not designed for traders or speculative investors.

How It Is Used
Users interact with QWBQ directly on mainnet by:

Sending token transfers between wallets
Testing approval and allowance mechanisms
Monitoring Transfer and Approval event logs
Observing holder distribution changes
Verifying the permanently fixed total supply
For What Purpose It Is Used
QWBQ is used to demonstrate:

Real gas consumption
Real transaction confirmation
Immutable ledger recording
Standard BEP-20 event emission
Fixed supply contract behavior
Exact Educational Role
The educational role of QWBQ is to serve as a live reference model of a minimal BEP-20 contract on mainnet.

Unlike simulated environments, QWBQ allows learners to observe:

How supply remains constant
How allowances are granted and reduced
How events are emitted and recorded
How holder distribution evolves
How gas behaves in real network conditions
How Tokens Reach Users
QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational interaction.

There is:

No ICO
No presale
No public sale
No liquidity pool
No exchange listing
Distribution is gradual and visible on-chain.

Contributors
The project is initiated and coordinated by the Founder.

Independent contributors assist in documentation, technical review, and website maintenance.

Contract ownership remains under the deployer address to preserve reference stability.

None of the contributors have control over the contract logic or token supply.

Ownership Verification – BscScan Verified Signature
For transparency, the contract ownership has been publicly verified through a signed message on BscScan.

Verified Signature ID: #15181
Deployer / Owner Address: 0x0daeb75bf06b879164d0753fa9d695763fcd1f49
View on BscScan: https://bscscan.com/verifySig/15181
Status: Verified
This verification confirms full ownership and accountability. The contract contains no owner-accessible modification functions.

Smart Contract Functions Summary
The smart contract implements only standard BEP-20 functions: transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance, balanceOf, totalSupply, name, symbol, decimals. No custom functions, no administrative controls, and no privileged roles exist.

Risk Disclosure
Interacting with blockchain tokens involves inherent risks, including smart contract behavior, network conditions, and user error. The project assumes no responsibility for user actions.
