1. Project Overview – Very Clear and Detailed Explanation
QUAZENTHOR (QWBQ) is a completely standard BEP-20 digital token that has been deployed on the BNB Smart Chain (also known as BSC). This project was created from the very beginning with a strong focus on transparency, full public verifiability, and serving only as an educational and technical demonstration for people who want to learn about blockchain, smart contracts, and how tokens work on public networks like BNB Smart Chain.

The main goal of QUAZENTHOR is to show – in a real, live, on-chain environment – how a very simple, completely immutable (unchangeable), and fully public token can function securely, predictably, and without any hidden tricks, secret controls, complex rewards, taxes, or speculative features. Everything is designed to be as straightforward and easy to understand as possible for educational purposes.

Every single piece of information about this token—including the total supply, all transactions ever made, who deployed it, the current owner status, and the exact smart contract code—is permanently recorded on the public blockchain and can be checked independently by anyone at any time using free public tools like BscScan (the official BNB Smart Chain explorer). There are no secrets, no private parts, and no trust needed beyond what the public blockchain itself provides.

Important repeated reminder: This token and project have zero connection to any financial promises, profit expectations, or investment schemes. It is strictly for learning how blockchains and tokens operate in practice.

Rationale for Existence: The project provides a verifiable example for blockchain education, addressing the need for hands-on learning resources. Current users: developers studying BEP-20, students exploring explorers. See lifecycle.html for full details.

2. Official Token Information (Full BEP-20 Standard Specifications – Updated & Verified)
BNB Symbol Rotating
Here is every important detail about the token, all of which follows the official BEP-20 standard created by the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. You can verify every item yourself directly on BscScan.

Token Name: QUAZENTHOR
Symbol: QWBQ (no relation to other entities; coincidental only)
Standard: BEP-20 (fully with all required functions like transfer, approve, allowance, balanceOf, totalSupply, etc.)
Decimals: 18 (standard precision for divisibility, same as most tokens on BSC)
Total Supply: 5,000,000,000,000 QWBQ (exactly 5 trillion tokens – this number is fixed forever and cannot change)
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
Contract Address: 0x013f5f2F7F5b027012415A783ac2ed69EF936aE8
BscScan Source Code Verification Date: 2026-01-31 (the code was publicly verified on this date, meaning BscScan confirmed that the published source code exactly matches the live deployed bytecode – anyone can audit it)
Because this token follows the official BEP-20 rules exactly and has no extra custom logic beyond the standard, every transfer, balance check, or approval works precisely as expected in the BNB Smart Chain documentation. There are no surprises during normal use.

3. Fixed Supply & Complete Immutability – Explained in Detail
The total number of QWBQ tokens is permanently locked and capped at exactly 5,000,000,000,000 (5 trillion). This number was set once when the contract was deployed, and it is now mathematically impossible to change it in any way.

All 5 trillion tokens were created (minted) only one single time during the initial deployment of the smart contract. After that moment:

There is no mint function left in the code → impossible to create even 1 extra token
There is no burn function that can be abused or triggered unexpectedly
There is no inflation mechanism, no scheduled emissions, no additional releases
There are no hidden admin controls to add supply later
The supply is 100% immutable and verifiable on-chain forever
This design gives every user complete certainty and predictability: the total amount of tokens will never increase or be manipulated. You can check the totalSupply() function on BscScan right now and it will always show the same number.

4. Smart Contract Design Philosophy – Minimal, Safe, and Fully Explained
The smart contract was written to be as simple, clean, readable, and safe as possible. The goal was to remove every possible source of risk, confusion, or hidden behavior that could harm users or lead to misunderstandings.

No extra functions beyond standard BEP-20: Only the basic required methods are implemented. No custom code for taxes, rewards, fees, reflections, burns, or any other mechanics.
No owner privileges: The contract has no "onlyOwner" modifiers or admin functions that could allow changes after deployment. Once deployed, it's 100% hands-off and permanent.
No proxy or upgradable patterns: The code is a single, flat contract with no way to upgrade or replace it later. What you see is what you get, forever.
Fully open-source and verified: The exact Solidity code is published on BscScan with a verified match to the deployed bytecode. Anyone can read and audit it line by line.
No dependencies or external calls: The contract doesn't rely on any other contracts, oracles, or external data. It's completely self-contained and isolated.
This philosophy makes QUAZENTHOR one of the simplest possible tokens – perfect for educational study, as there's nothing complicated to explain or worry about.

5. No Financial Features or Utility – Strict Educational Design
QUAZENTHOR has absolutely no financial or utility features. It was designed this way on purpose to avoid any confusion or false expectations:

No taxes or fees on transfers: Every transaction is standard with zero added costs or redistributions.
No rewards, staking, or yield: There are no ways to earn more tokens or generate passive income.
No governance or voting: Holding tokens gives zero rights, influence, or control over anything.
No NFT, DeFi, or ecosystem integration: It's not part of any larger protocol or platform.
The token is purely a demonstration tool for understanding basic token transfers and on-chain verification.

The project has no roadmap, milestones, or future development plans. The project is complete at deployment.

The token has no utility, use-case, or functional purpose beyond being a live BEP-20 reference contract.

Interacting with blockchain tokens involves inherent risks, including smart contract risk, network congestion, and user error. The project assumes no responsibility for user actions.

This token is not a security, financial instrument, or investment product. Nothing constitutes financial or legal advice.
