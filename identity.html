  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">1. Project Identity & Clear Public Definition – Detailed Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>QUAZENTHOR</strong> is a completely independent, non-corporate blockchain educational project deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain using the standard BEP-20 token protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project consists of a single, immutable smart contract (verified on BscScan since January 31, 2026), accompanied by open, truthful documentation, fully disclosed ownership, and publicly identifiable contributors. Its only goal is to serve as a real-world, on-chain reference for how a minimal, transparent, and predictable BEP-20 token can exist without complexity, hidden features, or financial mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>
    QUAZENTHOR is explicitly NOT a company, foundation, DAO, investment platform, financial service, startup, or profit-oriented entity. It does not operate under any registered corporate structure, does not represent shares, securities, equity, or utility, and does not have any employees, shareholders, board members, or commercial operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The token name and symbol are used solely for project identification and do not represent or affiliate with any existing entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Symbol QWBQ has no relation to any university, company, or prior projects; coincidental similarity only.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Rationale for Existence:</strong> Strictly educational demonstration of immutable BEP-20 behavior. Refer to lifecycle.html and changelog.html for full context.
  </p>
  <p>
    The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment.
  </p>
  <p style="font-style:italic; color:#27ae60;">
    This website serves as the official and actively maintained information source for the QUAZENTHOR project. Documentation updates and revisions are recorded in the project changelog. <strong>Last updated: February 01, 2026.</strong>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">2. Ownership Identification & Accountability – Full & Verifiable Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    The QUAZENTHOR project is owned, deployed, and maintained by a single, publicly identified individual: toora dokht (founder and sole owner).
  </p>
  <p>
    The founder accepts full, direct, and personal accountability for every aspect of the project, including (but not limited to):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smart contract deployment and verification (on-chain since 2026-01-31)</li>
    <li>All public disclosures, documentation, and website content accuracy</li>
    <li>Maintenance of all official channels and profiles</li>
    <li>Response to verification inquiries or explorer reviews</li>
    <li>Ensuring complete non-financial and educational-only focus</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">Founder Public Profiles (multiple verifiable channels for independent identity confirmation):

<p>
    These are the only official channels and resources for QUAZENTHOR. Beware of fakes or impersonators.

  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">3. Core Team Accountability – Public Roles & Profiles</h2>
  <p>
    The project is supported by a small, publicly identified core team with clearly defined, non-financial roles:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>btmb ani – Documentation & Coordination – Ensures alignment with on-chain data and transparency standards.</li>
    <li>so stbt – Communication Support – Provides factual, non-promotional responses.</li>
    <li>amob animo – Technical Review – Contributes to code clarity for educational purposes only.</li>
    <li>mekro deo – Website Maintenance – Monitors links, accessibility, and basic security checks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All team roles are operational, technical, or informational only. No team member has financial, token-management, fundraising, or economic responsibilities of any kind.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">4. Risk Disclosure</h2>
  <p style="color:#c0392b; font-weight:bold;">
    Interacting with any blockchain token or network carries inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, network congestion, user errors, and potential permanent loss of assets. This project assumes no responsibility or liability for any user actions, interpretations, losses, or decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The token is not a security, financial instrument, investment product, or utility token. Nothing on this website constitutes financial, investment, or legal advice.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">5. Non-Misrepresentation Policy – Strict Independence & Originality</h2>
  <p>
    QUAZENTHOR does not impersonate, affiliate with, or derive credibility from any third-party project, brand, company, or public entity. All content is 100% original, truthful, and created specifically for this educational demonstration.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is fully independent and has zero affiliation, partnership, endorsement, sponsorship, or connection with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Binance, BNB Chain team, or Binance Smart Chain developers</li>
    <li>BscScan, Trust Wallet, PancakeSwap, or any exchange/platform</li>
    <li>Any government, regulatory body, financial institution, or third-party organization</li>
    <li>Any similarly named token, project, or brand</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any coincidental similarity in terminology is unintentional and does not imply relationship or borrowed legitimacy. This policy is stated to fully address any concerns about misrepresentation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="gold-subtitle">6. Official Public Resources – All Verifiable Channels</h2>
  <p>
    These are the only official resources for QUAZENTHOR. Each is maintained for transparency and education only — no promotion or financial content.

  <p>
    This page is created and published specifically to meet and exceed blockchain explorer transparency requirements, including those of BscScan, for clear project identity, disclosed ownership, team accountability, non-anonymous control, and truthful representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    All information here is complete, factual, consistent, and aligned with every other official QUAZENTHOR resource (About, Tokenomics, Team pages). The project is ready for review as a transparent, educational-only, immutable BEP-20 demonstration.
