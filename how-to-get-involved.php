  <h1>How to Get Involved</h1>
  <p>QWBQ is an educational reference token. Involvement is limited to technical and learning purposes only. There are no financial opportunities, sales, or investments.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Token Acquisition and Distribution</h2>
    <p>QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational interaction. To request tokens for educational purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact via official email: <a href="mailto:admin@quazenthor.com">admin@quazenthor.com</a> with a brief description of your educational or technical use case (e.g., testing transfers, analyzing events).</li>
      <li>Distribution is gradual, manual, and visible on-chain.</li>
      <li>No ICO, presale, public sale, liquidity pool, or exchange listing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Educational Uses</h2>
    <p>Once you have tokens, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send token transfers between wallets.</li>
