<h2 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">1. Purpose of This Page</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
This page provides a complete, authoritative, and expanded list of all official public communication channels, social profiles, and verification resources associated with the QUAZENTHOR (QWBQ). We have detailed each channel with explanations of its purpose, management, and usage to ensure full transparency about the project and token.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
The QUAZENTHOR is a standard BEP-20 token on the BNB Smart Chain, fully compliant with BEP-20 specifications (including transfer, balance, and approval functions). It exists solely for educational and transparency demonstration purposes, with no financial features. This page exists specifically to support identity verification, ownership transparency, and independent review by blockchain explorers, including <strong>BscScan</strong>. All information is factual, verifiable, and free from any misrepresentation of public entities or other projects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Rationale for Existence:</strong> The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
This website serves as the official and actively maintained information source for the QUAZENTHOR project. Documentation updates and revisions are recorded in the project changelog. Last updated: February 06, 2026.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
The website is secured with a valid SSL certificate issued by Certum DV TLS G2 R39 CA, valid from January 31, 2026 to January 31, 2027, covering quazenthor.com and www.quazenthor.com (Serial Number: 668ab2e067bd7b8b129757692ec967e9, Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption). It resolves to IP 78.47.123.194 and is trusted by all major browsers.
