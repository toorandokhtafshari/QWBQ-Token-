<h3 class="gold-subtitle">1. Transparency Commitment – Maximum Openness & Verifiability</h3>

<p>
This dedicated transparency page is created specifically to provide the **most explicit, detailed, and independently verifiable** identification of every single individual who has any responsibility for maintaining, documenting, or supporting the QUAZENTHOR Token project.
</p>

<p>
In full accordance with blockchain best practices, public disclosure standards, and especially the transparency and accountability requirements often requested by platforms like BscScan (for token verification, listing, or audit purposes), **QUAZENTHOR operates in a completely non-anonymous manner**. Every person with any defined role is publicly named right here, and each provides multiple **accessible, public, professional-oriented profiles** that anyone can check at any time.
</p>

<p>
There are **absolutely no** hidden operators, secret administrators, undisclosed controllers, shadow developers, anonymous moderators, or any other unlisted participants who have influence or access to the project. **Only** the exact individuals listed on this page — with their full roles clearly explained — have any official connection or responsibility. This level of openness is intentional to build trust through facts that can be independently confirmed on public platforms.
</p>

<p><strong>Repeated for emphasis</strong>: The project has zero anonymous elements. All contributors are publicly disclosed here with links to their real, active profiles where their work and identity can be seen.
</p>

<p>
Team members are publicly identifiable through professional profiles used for accountability and communication. Social platforms are supplementary and not used as identity verification.

<h3 class="gold-subtitle">2. Project Structure (Strictly Non-Corporate, Non-Financial Model) – Detailed Explanation</h3>
<p>
QUAZENTHOR Token is **not** a registered company, not a startup, not a DAO, not an investment platform, not a financial service, and not any form of profit-oriented entity. It is purely and strictly an **independently maintained educational blockchain demonstration project** focused on showing how a simple, immutable, fully transparent BEP-20 token can exist on a public network like BNB Smart Chain.
</p>
<p>
Because of this clear non-commercial nature, the project has **none** of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No shareholders or investors</li>
<li>No employees or salaries</li>
<li>No offices or physical locations</li>
<li>No legal entity registration</li>
<li>No financial operations, budgets, or revenue</li>
<li>No governance or voting mechanisms</li>
<li>No partnerships or collaborations</li>
<li>No marketing or promotion teams</li>
</ul>
<p>

The project is maintained voluntarily by the identified individuals listed below, each with strictly limited, clearly defined, and non-financial roles. All contributions are for educational purposes only, with no compensation or economic incentives involved.
</p>
<p>
**Owner/Founder**: toora dokht – The individual who deployed the immutable contract and oversees transparency. No ongoing control; contract is permanent post-deployment.
</p>
<p>
**Team Members**: Four publicly identified contributors with specific, limited support roles (detailed below). No hierarchy; all roles are equal and operational only.
