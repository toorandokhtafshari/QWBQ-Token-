<!-- ================= PROJECT IDENTITY ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">1. Project Identity, Scope & Clear Definition – Repeated for Maximum Clarity</h3>

<p>
QUAZENTHOR Token (symbol: QWBQ) is a standard, immutable BEP-20 token deployed exclusively on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The contract address is 0x013f5f2F7F5b027012415A783ac2ed69EF936aE8, with source code fully verified on BscScan since January 31, 2026.
</p>

<p>
This project exists solely as a decentralized digital token and a static informational website to document its technical structure, minimal design philosophy, immutability, and on-chain presence for educational purposes. The project has no roadmap, milestones, or future development plans. The project is complete at deployment.
</p>

<p>
QUAZENTHOR is explicitly NOT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A registered company, foundation, DAO, or legal entity</li>
  <li>A financial institution, investment platform, or service provider</li>
  <li>A fundraising mechanism, profit-sharing scheme, or yield-generating asset</li>
  <li>A commercial product or utility with off-chain dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>
No promises of profit, revenue, dividends, price appreciation, financial returns, or investment outcomes are made, implied, or suggested anywhere on this site or in related materials. The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment.
</p>

<p>
Key immutable facts (verifiable on BscScan):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total Supply: Exactly 5,000,000,000,000 QWBQ (5 trillion) – permanently fixed, no minting possible</li>
  <li>Decimals: 18</li>
  <li>No taxes, fees, reflections, blacklists, or pause functions</li>
  <li>No upgradeable logic – contract is final and immutable</li>
</ul>

<p>
This section is deliberately repeated and detailed to eliminate any ambiguity during BscScan or third-party compliance reviews regarding the project's nature, intent, boundaries, and non-financial status. The token has no utility, use-case, or functional purpose beyond being a live BEP-20 reference contract.
</p>

<!-- ================= TEAM & FOUNDER TRANSPARENCY ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">2. Founder, Team & Full Accountability Disclosure – Public Professional Profiles</h3>

<!-- ================= NO DATA COLLECTION ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">5. Complete & Absolute Absence of Personal or Behavioral Data Collection</h3>

<p>
This website does not collect, request, store, process, infer, or analyze any personal or behavioral data whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Explicitly not collected:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names, emails, addresses, or identifiers</li>
  <li>IP addresses for profiling (only transient server logs if any, never stored/used)</li>
  <li>Device/browser fingerprints, user agents for tracking</li>
  <li>Geolocation, time zones, or session data</li>
  <li>Analytics metrics, visit counts, heatmaps, or usage patterns</li>
  <li>Wallet addresses, transaction data, or blockchain interactions (handled directly on-chain)</li>
</ul>

<p>
No databases, cookies for identification, local storage for tracking, or third-party embeds exist.

<hr>

<!-- ================= COOKIES ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">6. Zero Cookies, Zero Tracking, Zero Analytics</h3>

<p>
No cookies are set or used for any purpose — no tracking, no advertising, no session management, no preferences.
</p>

<p>
No third-party scripts, pixels, beacons, Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Cloudflare analytics, or any monitoring services are loaded.
</p>

<p>
The site is served as pure static HTML/CSS — no JavaScript required for core functionality, no external dependencies that track.
</p>

<!-- ================= BLOCKCHAIN DATA ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">7. Blockchain Interactions – Public & Independent</h3>

<p>
All token-related activity (transfers, balances) occurs directly on BNB Smart Chain via users' own wallets.
</p>

<p>
This website does not create, store, control, or access blockchain data — it only links to public explorers like BscScan for verification.
</p>

<p>
Users interact peer-to-peer with the immutable contract — no intermediary, no custody by project maintainers.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= TECHNICAL ================= -->

<h3 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">8. Technical Architecture – Pure Static & Minimal</h3>

<p>
This is a 100% static informational website hosted on a simple server or CDN.
</p>

<p>
No backend servers, APIs, databases, user authentication, forms, or dynamic content generation exist.
</p>

<p>
No server-side logging of personal data occurs — only standard HTTP access logs (if any) are transient and not used for profiling.
