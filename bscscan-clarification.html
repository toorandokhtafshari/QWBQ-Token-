<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">Introduction & Purpose</h2>

<p>
This page serves as an official clarification document specifically created for blockchain explorers like BscScan, as well as for any member of the public interested in verifying the identity, ownership, and technical details of the QUAZENTHOR (QWBQ). We have expanded this section to provide more context and ensure full transparency. The QUAZENTHOR is a simple, educational smart contract demonstration built on the BNB Smart Chain. It was created to showcase basic token functionality without any financial or speculative elements. This document explains everything in simple, straightforward language, breaking down each aspect step by step so that anyone can understand and verify the information independently.
</p>

<p>
The sole purpose of this document is to promote transparency. It is not meant to promote the token, provide financial advice, or encourage any form of investment. We emphasize that this is purely informational and educational. No part of this page discusses prices, profits, trading strategies, or potential returns, as the token is not designed for financial purposes.
</p>

<p>
Every single statement here is based on factual, verifiable evidence. You can check this through:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On-chain contract data directly from the blockchain explorer like BscScan.</li>
<li>The verified smart contract source code, which is publicly available and has been audited for accuracy.</li>
<li>Official project resources, including our website and social channels, all linked below.</li>
<li>Public contact channels where you can reach out for further verification if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To address any concerns about clarity, we have expanded all sections with detailed explanations, avoiding technical jargon where possible, and providing step-by-step breakdowns. No claims are made about financial performance, and all information is presented honestly without any distortion of facts from public entities or other projects.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Rationale for Existence:</strong> Educational demonstration. See lifecycle.html and changelog.html.
</p>

<p>
The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment.
</p

<p>
This website serves as the official and actively maintained information source for the QUAZENTHOR project. Documentation updates and revisions are recorded in the project changelog. Last updated: February 01, 2026.
</p>

<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">1. Token Identification & Basic Metadata</h2>

<p>
In this section, we provide a complete and clear overview of the token's basic details. This information uniquely identifies the QUAZENTHOR and allows anyone to verify it directly on the blockchain. We have expanded this to include explanations of each term, why it's important, and how to check it yourself. For example, the token follows the BEP-20 standard, which is the standard for tokens on BNB Smart Chain, ensuring compatibility with wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask.
</p>

<p>
The token name and symbol are used solely for project identification and do not represent or affiliate with any existing entity.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Token Name:</strong> quazenthor – This is the full name of the token, chosen to be unique and not similar to any existing projects. It helps identify the token in wallets and explorers.</li>
<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> QWBQ – A short code (like a ticker symbol) used for quick reference. Symbol QWBQ has no relation to any university, company, or prior projects; coincidental similarity only.</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> BEP-20 – This means the token follows the official rules for tokens on BNB Smart Chain, including functions like transferring tokens or checking balances.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> BNB Smart Chain – The blockchain where the token lives, known for fast and cheap transactions, making it ideal for educational purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 5,000,000,000,000 (5.00T) – The total number of tokens that will ever exist. This is fixed and cannot change, which you can verify by calling the totalSupply function on the contract.</li>
<li><strong>Decimals:</strong> 18 – This defines how the token can be divided (like cents in a dollar). 18 is the standard for most tokens, allowing very small fractions.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Address:</strong> <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x013f5f2F7F5b027012415A783ac2ed69EF936aE8" target="_blank">0x013f5f2F7F5b027012415A783ac2ed69EF936aE8</a> – This is the unique address of the smart contract on the blockchain. You can paste this into BscScan to see all details, including the verified source code, transaction history, and token holders.</li>
<li><strong>Verification Date:</strong> 2026-01-31 – The date when the source code was publicly verified on BscScan, confirming that the code matches the deployed contract exactly. This allows anyone to audit the code for security and accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To verify any of this information yourself:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://bscscan.com" target="_blank">BscScan.com</a> (the official explorer for BNB Smart Chain).</li>
<li>Enter the contract address in the search bar.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Contract' tab to see the verified source code.</li>
<li>Use the 'Read Contract' tab to check parameters like total supply or decimals directly from the blockchain.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This setup ensures that no trust is required — everything is public and verifiable on-chain.
</p>
</section>

<h2 class="gold-subtitle" style="color: red;">2. Smart Contract Structure & Immutability Details</h2>

<p>
The smart contract for QUAZENTHOR is designed to be as simple and secure as possible. We've expanded this section to explain each feature in detail, why it's included (or not), and how it contributes to transparency and safety. The contract only includes the basic BEP-20 functions (like transfer, approve, and balance checks) and nothing extra. This minimal design reduces risks and makes it easy to understand for educational purposes.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No Mint Function:</strong> There is no way to create new tokens after deployment. This ensures the total supply remains fixed forever, preventing inflation or unexpected changes. Why? To demonstrate supply immutability in a real token.</li>
<li><strong>No Burn Function:</strong> Tokens cannot be destroyed or removed from circulation by anyone, including the owner. This keeps the supply predictable. Why? To show a truly fixed-supply model without reduction mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>No Fees or Taxes on Transactions:</strong> Every transfer is standard and free of any automatic deductions, rewards, or redistributions. Why? To avoid complexity and focus on basic token behavior.</li>
<li><strong>No Blacklist, Pause, or Freeze Functions:</strong> No ability to block addresses or stop the contract. All users can interact freely. Why? To emphasize decentralization and lack of central control.</li>
<li><strong>No Upgradeable Features:</strong> The contract cannot be changed or upgraded after deployment. It's permanent as-is. Why? To highlight immutability, a key blockchain principle.</li>
<li><strong>No Owner Control Over Balances:</strong> The owner cannot access, move, or alter anyone's tokens. Why? To prevent any risk of misuse and build trust through code.</li>
<li><strong>Verified Source Code on BscScan:</strong> The full Solidity code is publicly available and confirmed to match the deployed version. Why? For anyone to audit and verify safety independently.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior Permanently Defined by Bytecode:</strong> The contract's logic is fixed in the on-chain code, unchangeable forever. Why? To provide a stable example for study.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To verify the contract structure:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Visit the contract address on BscScan: <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x013f5f2F7F5b027012415A783ac2ed69EF936aE8" target="_blank">Contract Page</a> – This direct link shows the contract details.</li>
<li>Go to the 'Contract' tab and read the source code line by line.</li>
<li>Look for the absence of functions like 'mint', 'burn', or 'pause' – they don't exist.</li>
<li>Check the 'Read Contract' tab to confirm parameters like total supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This design makes QUAZENTHOR one of the simplest possible tokens, perfect for educational analysis and transparency.
