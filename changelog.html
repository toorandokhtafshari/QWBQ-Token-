        <div class="accordion-header">February 1, 2026 – Morning refinement & final pre-submission polish</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
                <li>Added explicit and prominent statement "No future token transfers, distributions, or movements from the deployer wallet are planned or intended" in both Token Holders section of whitepaper and Scope Declaration page to eliminate any possible ambiguity regarding supply control.</li>
                <li>Significantly improved and centralized the "Why the token exists" explanation by placing a bold, dedicated paragraph at the very beginning of whitepaper.html and Scope Declaration.html using the exact recommended wording: "The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment."</li>
                <li>Conducted full reachability test on all team professional links (LinkedIn, GitHub, X, Telegram, Email) and removed any potentially inactive or low-activity social links (Instagram, Facebook, Medium) to prevent crawler rejection due to broken or suspicious endpoints.</li>
                <li>Refined wording in Risk Disclosure section to make it more comprehensive and user-focused, including explicit mention of "user error (wrong address, wrong network)" and "no guarantees regarding usability, outcomes, or protection against losses".</li>
                <li>Updated Legal Disclaimer to clearly state "This document is informational and educational only and does not constitute legal, financial, tax, or investment advice" in a more prominent position.</li>
                <li>Added visible "Last updated" date line in all main pages (index, whitepaper, Scope Declaration, changelog) with exact format: "Last updated: February 1, 2026" to demonstrate ongoing active maintenance.</li>
                <li>Minor typography and spacing improvements across whitepaper sections for better readability during manual review by explorer team.</li>
                <li>Verified that no financial language (investment, profit, yield, moon, pump, etc.) remains anywhere in the documentation.</li>
                <li>Ensured all internal links (Back to Home, Whitepaper, Scope Declaration) are correctly pointing and functional.</li>
                <li>Prepared submission notes for BscScan update request with emphasis on educational purpose, immutability, and transparency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small">Purpose: Final refinements to maximize clarity, compliance alignment, and reduce any risk of rejection due to unclear statements or broken links. All changes are documentation-only.</p>

    <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-header">January 31, 2026 – Major documentation expansion, SSL verification & active maintenance demonstration</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
                <li>Added a complete, detailed SSL certificate verification section (section 24) to whitepaper.html including full server details, SANs, validity period (Jan 31, 2026 – Jan 31, 2027), serial number, signature algorithm, issuer, chain certificates, and root CA information directly extracted from SSL Checker results.</li>
                <li>Expanded Scope Declaration page with new subsections: Completed Milestones, Ongoing Maintenance – Documentation Only, Permanent Exclusions (detailed 11-item list of what will never happen), Verification/Accuracy/Originality/Independence statement, and Official Verification Channels list with direct BscScan links.</li>
                <li>Ensured team bios in whitepaper and Scope Declaration only include active professional links: LinkedIn, GitHub, X, Telegram, and project Email — removed or commented out any potentially inactive Instagram, Facebook, Medium, Bitcointalk links to avoid rejection risk.</li>
                <li>Published this changelog.html page as a dedicated, public log to visibly demonstrate that the website is actively maintained with dated, traceable updates.</li>
                <li>Reinforced the core educational purpose statement ("permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior") in multiple locations: Token Details, Executive Summary, Project Overview, and Scope Declaration.</li>
                <li>Added visible "Last updated: January 31, 2026" footer note across index.html, whitepaper.html, and Scope Declaration.html with link to this changelog page.</li>
                <li>Completed full review of Risk Disclosure, Legal Disclaimer, No Roadmap, No Utility sections to ensure they are comprehensive, non-promotional, and aligned with best practices for educational tokens.</li>
                <li>Verified contract address, ownership signature (#15181), and deployer wallet details are correctly and prominently displayed in multiple pages with direct BscScan explorer links.</li>
                <li>Ensured no self-certifying phrases like "compliant with BscScan" or "satisfies explorer standards" remain; replaced with neutral wording: "This documentation is provided for transparency and review purposes."</li>
                <li>Added internal navigation links at the bottom of changelog for easy access back to Home, Whitepaper, and Scope Declaration.</li>
                <li>Performed manual cross-check of all external links in team bios and official channels to confirm they resolve correctly without redirects or errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="small">Purpose: To fulfill BscScan requirements for a live, actively maintained website with verifiable updates, full transparency, secure SSL, and clear educational intent. All modifications are limited to documentation and presentation.</p>
