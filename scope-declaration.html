<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">1. Project Identity & Clear Definition</h2>

<p>
This scope declaration is a detailed, non-speculative document outlining the completed milestones and permanent boundaries of the QUAZENTHOR Token (QWBQ) project. It is prepared exclusively for transparency, educational purposes, and to support review on blockchain explorers like BscScan.
</p>

<p>
QUAZENTHOR Token (QWBQ) is a minimal, standard BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain with a permanently fixed supply and an immutable smart contract. The token includes only basic BEP-20 functions (e.g., transfer, approve, balanceOf) and no additional logic that could imply financial utility.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, QUAZENTHOR is <strong>not</strong> an investment, security, fundraising instrument, or profit-generating product. There are no promises, expectations, or implications of appreciation, yield, financial return, or economic benefits. The project has never conducted and will never conduct any token sales, ICOs, presales, staking programs, or reward mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
The token exists solely as a transparent, verifiable, and educational blockchain reference, demonstrating how a simple token can be created with full public disclosure. This aligns with the emphasis on clear, non-misleading information for public review. The token exists as a permanent public on-chain reference used by learners and developers to study immutable BEP-20 contract behavior in a live network environment.
</p>

<p>
The token name and symbol are used solely for project identification and do not represent or affiliate with any existing entity.
</p>

<p>
This document is prepared specifically to provide clear identification, accountability, and factual disclosure for blockchain explorer review and public verification. It avoids any promotional language and focuses on facts.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">2. Completed Milestones – Project Lifecycle</h2>

<p>
QUAZENTHOR is a completed project at deployment. All milestones were achieved during the initial setup phase, with no ongoing development or future plans. Completed actions include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smart contract development – Standard BEP-20 template used, no custom logic. This step ensured the contract was simple and verifiable.</li>
  <li>Deployment on BNB Smart Chain – Fixed supply minted, immutable contract. Deployment was done on January 31, 2026, with all tokens allocated to the deployer for educational control.</li>
  <li>Source code verification on BscScan – Full transparency achieved, with bytecode match confirmed.</li>
  <li>Ownership verification via signed message – Publicly confirmed on BscScan to establish accountability.</li>
  <li>Official website launch – Documentation published for public review, with SSL security and maintenance protocols in place.</li>
  <li>Team disclosure – Public bios and professional profiles provided for transparency.</li>
  <li>SSL certificate installation – Website security ensured to maintain accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>
No token distribution, sales, or transfers have occurred. The project is now in a maintenance-only state for documentation accuracy, with changes logged in the changelog.
</p>

<p>
The smart contract implements only standard BEP-20 functions: transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance, balanceOf, totalSupply, name, symbol, decimals. No custom functions, no administrative controls, and no privileged roles exist. Token name and symbol are permanently fixed and cannot be modified after deployment. The contract contains no owner-accessible metadata modification functions.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">3. Ongoing Maintenance – Documentation Only</h2>

<p>
The only ongoing activity is minimal documentation maintenance to ensure accuracy and accessibility. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updating the changelog with any minor revisions (e.g., typo fixes, broken link repairs). All changes are recorded and dated for transparency.</li>
  <li>Maintaining website uptime and security checks (no content changes). Regular monitoring ensures the site remains accessible without issues.</li>
  <li>Responding to transparency inquiries via official email (admin@quazenthor.com). Responses are factual and non-promotional.</li>
</ul>

<p>
No new content, features, or changes to the token's scope will occur. This maintenance is non-developmental and transparency-focused, aligning with the project's completed status.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">4. Token Supply</h2>

<p>
The total supply of QUAZENTHOR (QWBQ) is fixed at 5,000,000,000,000 tokens, minted entirely at contract deployment. There are no minting, burning, or supply adjustment functions in the smart contract.
</p>

<p>
At deployment, 100% of the supply was minted to the deployer address as part of the standard BEP-20 creation process, verifiable on-chain via the contract address.
</p>

<p>
No presales, ICOs, private placements, airdrops, or fundraising events occurred. No promises or allocations were made to investors or third parties. The supply remains immutable for educational demonstration.
</p>

<p>
Future transfers do not represent distribution, sale, or fundraising.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">5. Permanent Exclusions – What Will Never Happen</h2>

<p>
To prevent speculation and ensure reviewer confidence, the following are explicitly and permanently excluded from the project scope:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Token sales, airdrops, giveaways, or distributions – No ICO/IDO or any form of token offering.</li>
  <li>Staking, farming, yield, rewards, or incentives – No economics or benefit mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Exchange listings, liquidity pools, or trading pairs – No markets or trading facilitation.</li>
  <li>Partnerships, integrations, or collaborations – Independent project with no external ties.</li>
  <li>Foundations, companies, DAOs, or external organizations – Small team only, no entities.</li>
  <li>Upgrades, new features, smart contract changes, or proxy implementations – Immutable design.</li>
  <li>Marketing, promotion, community building, or hype campaigns – Transparency focus only.</li>
  <li>Any claim of affiliation with Binance, BNB Chain, or third parties – No distortions or associations.</li>
  <li>Token distribution, secondary sales, or any form of transfer from deployer wallet – Supply remains centralized for educational demonstration.</li>
  <li>Any future development, updates beyond documentation maintenance, or evolution of the project scope – Static and complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These exclusions are intentional, permanent, and documented to prevent misinterpretation, false expectations, or association with unrelated projects.
</p>

<p>
The token name and symbol are used solely for project identification and do not represent or affiliate with any existing entity.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">6. Verification, Accuracy, Originality & Independence</h2>

<p>
All scope declaration statements are independently verifiable through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immutable on-chain data on BNB Smart Chain – Contract address provided.</li>
  <li>Verified smart contract source code on BscScan – No hidden code.</li>
  <li>Public website content and historical consistency – Original materials.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All information is 100% original — no copying from other projects, templates, public entities, or institutions. The project is fully independent — no affiliation with Binance, BNB Chain, BscScan, Trust Wallet, or any third-party organization.
</p>
</section>

<hr>

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<section>
<h2 class="gold-subtitle">7. Final Compliance & Disclosure Statement</h2>

<p>
This scope declaration exists solely for transparency, educational reference, and blockchain explorer verification.
</p>

<p>
It does not constitute an offer, solicitation, forecast, roadmap of development, or representation of future value, activity, or utility.
</p>

<p>
QUAZENTHOR Token is a completed, immutable, educational demonstration — nothing more.
</p>

<p>
The project has no roadmap, milestones, or future development plans. The project is complete at deployment.
</p>

<p>
The token has no utility, use-case, or functional purpose beyond being a live BEP-20 reference contract.
</p>
