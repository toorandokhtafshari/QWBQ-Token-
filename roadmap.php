  <h1>Roadmap & Project Phases</h1>
  <p>This roadmap outlines the educational phases of the Quazenthor (QWBQ) project, focusing on transparency, on-chain normalization, and real blockchain interaction. The project is non-financial and educational only.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 1: On-Chain Normalization</h2>
    <p>Goal: Create a natural distribution pattern, reduce apparent supply concentration, and establish observable operational footprints on the blockchain.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 2: Transparent Manual Distribution Model</h2>
    <p>Framework for Access and Distribution: QWBQ tokens are manually distributed by the founder to independent wallets for educational, technical, and testing purposes.</p>
    <p>No ICO, Presale, IDO, public offering, liquidity pool, or exchange listing exists. Distribution is solely based on requests for educational purposes.</p>
    <p>Recipients can: Perform transfers, test approval mechanisms, analyze event logs, observe holder distribution changes.</p>
    <p>This model is intentionally limited to preserve the token's role as a technical reference, not a financial tool.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 3: Supply Concentration Transparency</h2>
    <p>Transparency of Supply: A significant portion of the QWBQ supply is held in the deployer address.</p>
    <p>Educational distribution is ongoing gradually, with all changes transparently visible on-chain.</p>
    <p>No minting or supply increase is possible, and the total supply remains fixed forever.</p>
    <p>This structure maintains contract reference stability while preventing misconceptions about inactivity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 4: Enhanced Educational Interaction Scenario</h2>
    <p>Operational Context: QWBQ is deployed on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet to enable real blockchain interactions, not simulated testnet behavior.</p>
    <p>This enables: Real gas consumption, real event emission, permanent ledger recording, public verifiability by anyone.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 5: Neutral and Transparent Team Structure</h2>
    <p>The project is initiated and coordinated by the Founder. Independent collaborators contribute in documentation, technical review, and website maintenance.</p>
    <p>Contract ownership remains with the deployer to preserve implementation stability. None of the collaborators control the contract logic or token supply.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 6: Site Content Risk Cleanup</h2>
    <p>Items that should not appear: Any sentence portraying the project solely for explorer verification, defensive or justificatory tone, direct references to rejections.</p>
    <p>Prohibited phrases: No utility, No use-case, No roadmap, Project is complete, Written for BscScan, Entire supply held by deployer.</p>
    <p>Standard Replacements: Active educational interaction, Gradual on-chain distribution, Public technical reference deployment.</p>
    <p>The overall tone should be operational, educational, and professional, not defensive or reactive.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 7: Social Proof Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Goal: Prove project existence beyond a single website domain.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Phase 8: Final Site Content Structure</h2>
    <p>Home Page: What is QWBQ?, Why It Exists, Core Properties (Immutable, Fixed Supply, Mainnet Deployment, Verified Contract).</p>
    <p>About Page: Who Benefits, How It Is Used, Exact Educational Role, How Tokens Reach Users.</p>
    <p>Supply/Transparency Page: Supply Structure Clarification, Reason for deployer holding major supply, Explanation of no liquidity pool.</p>
    <p>Contributors Page: Project initiated by Founder, Independent contributors assist, Contract ownership with deployer for stability.</p>
