# QWBQ (Quazenthor)

Official Technical Reference Repository

Project Owner / Founder Bio
toora dokht is the founder, owner, and primary coordinator of the Quazenthor (QWBQ) project. With a strong background in blockchain development and smart contract deployment, she initiated this educational reference token to provide a transparent, immutable BEP-20 implementation on BNB Smart Chain mainnet. Her focus is on fostering real-world blockchain education through manual distribution for technical interactions, ensuring no financial or speculative elements. As the deployer, she maintains contract stability while overseeing gradual on-chain distribution for learners, developers, and researchers. She coordinates independent contributors for documentation and technical reviews, preserving the project's non-financial educational scope.

## Project Overview

**Quazenthor (QWBQ)** is a fixed-supply BEP-20 token deployed on the BNB Smart Chain mainnet as a public technical reference implementation. It enables real blockchain interaction with standard BEP-20 functions including transfers, approvals, allowance validation, and event observation. Educational distribution is performed manually and is fully transparent on-chain. The contract is immutable and contains no minting, burning, taxation, or upgradeability mechanisms.

This repository serves as the official public reference hub for project documentation, transparency disclosures, and technical verification resources.

**Sector:** Education / Technical Reference

## Core Properties

• Network: BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet)  
• Token Standard: BEP-20  
• Token Symbol: QWBQ  
• Total Supply: 5,000,000,000,000 QWBQ (Fixed)  
• Minting: Not available  
• Burning: Not available  
• Upgradeability: Not implemented  
• Taxation: None  

The contract is immutable and follows a minimal reference structure. Deployed on BNB Smart Chain mainnet.

## Why This Token Exists

QWBQ was created to provide a minimal and transparent BEP-20 reference contract deployed on BNB Smart Chain mainnet for real educational interaction.

The purpose of creating this token is to allow practical observation of how a fixed-supply BEP-20 contract behaves in a live blockchain environment.

It exists as a technical reference implementation — not as a financial or speculative product.

---

## Who Benefits From It

QWBQ is intended for:

* Students learning smart contract fundamentals  
* Developers studying BEP-20 token mechanics  
* Blockchain researchers analyzing on-chain behavior  
* Technical reviewers examining immutable contract design  

It is not designed for traders or speculative investors.

---

## How It Is Used

Users interact with QWBQ directly on mainnet by:

* Sending token transfers between wallets  
* Testing approval and allowance mechanisms  
* Monitoring Transfer and Approval event logs  
* Observing holder distribution changes  
* Verifying the permanently fixed total supply  

---

## For What Purpose It Is Used

QWBQ is used to demonstrate:

* Real gas consumption  
* Real transaction confirmation  
* Immutable ledger recording  
* Standard BEP-20 event emission  
* Fixed supply contract behavior  

---

## Exact Educational Role

The educational role of QWBQ is to serve as a live reference model of a minimal BEP-20 contract on mainnet.

Unlike simulated environments, QWBQ allows learners to observe:

* How supply remains constant  
* How allowances are granted and reduced  
* How events are emitted and recorded  
* How holder distribution evolves  
* How gas behaves in real network conditions  

QWBQ functions as a live on-chain educational reference for:

• Studying BEP-20 token mechanics  
• Observing Transfer and Approval events  
• Understanding allowance behavior  
• Monitoring holder distribution  
• Analyzing real gas usage on mainnet  
• Verifying fixed supply structure  

The project is designed strictly for technical and educational interaction.

Educational blockchain reference project • Non-financial • No token sale • No fundraising • No investment claims

## How Tokens Reach Users

QWBQ tokens are distributed manually upon request for educational interaction.

There is:

* No ICO  
* No presale  
* No public sale  
* No liquidity pool  
* No exchange listing  

Distribution is gradual and visible on-chain. Tokens are distributed manually by the founder to independent wallets for educational, technical, and testing purposes.

Recipients can:

* Perform transfers  
* Test Approval mechanisms  
* Analyze Event Logs  
* Observe holder distribution trends  

This distribution model is intentionally limited to maintain the token's role as a technical reference, not a financial or investment tool.

## Supply Structure Clarification

Total supply is permanently fixed.

No minting exists.  
No burning exists.  
No taxation exists.  
No upgradeability exists.  

A significant portion of the QWBQ supply is held by the deployer address. Educational distribution is ongoing gradually, and all changes are transparently visible on-chain.

No minting or supply increase is possible, ensuring the total supply remains fixed forever.

This structure maintains the stability of the reference contract while preventing misinterpretations of inactivity.
